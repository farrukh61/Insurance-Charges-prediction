1.1	Road map
To achieve the target following procedural steps were adopted:
>Data cleaning
>	Data visualization
>	Dividing the data into label(dependent variable) and features (independent variables)
>	Splitting the data into training and test sets
>	Finding an appropriate model with suitable hyperparameters with the help of GridSearchCV
>	Training the model with training data
>	Validating the model on train and test sets with different scoring parameters
